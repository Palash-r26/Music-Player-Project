# Music-Player-Project
A simple and interactive web-based Music Player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to play, pause, and navigate through audio tracks with an intuitive interface. It is a user-friendly media player created as part of my 1st semester micro (mini) project in B.TECH CSE
